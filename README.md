# the way of experimental games: an experimental game anarchy: a willowolf
a rad anarchist diy digital space for people with a passion for e x p e r i m e n t a l games

probable traits: *silly*, *playful*, *ridiculous yet serious*, cute, rad, inclusive, leader-less (anarchy), punk (DIY), uses ascii art, enjoys s t r a n g e things, likes mods and modding and customizing everything(!), loves Mr. Saturn and Robo and Princess Peach, child-like, caring, loving

*come 'n hang out* at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/BsUq9n3)  
or if that's empty, you can *read or halp make* the [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki)  
or if that sucks, maybe you can *halp make* [*this* web-site](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/), together(!), you just have to ask for permission

# notes
wouldn't it be nice... to have a simple experimental game database...?    
  - well, it's also quite cool to just have one giant file and use control+f to find what you want. In this way, none of the data hidden!
  - an even better idea: a social discovery site (like Letterboxd) for games! let the people create their favorite game lists
    - https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-are-getting-closer-to-a-letterboxd-for-games.91719/
      - try https://ggapp.io and igdb.com

maybe ascii art is the way to go..

## forums?
hrmm.. i’m not sure if a forum (Discourse) is necessary for this project… it’s so experimental that people are likely to be more interactive, and a forum just isn’t interactive enough! Or, perhaps, it's useful for non-real-time interactions, as people are often so busy...

todo:  
auto pull from the wiki (rahil627.github.io/experimental-game-anarchy) to push to the site's repo (/docs)?
  - :O the ultimate simple public wiki solution!
  - ...or could create a folder linked to the contents of the wiki repo
