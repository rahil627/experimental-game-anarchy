come 'n hang at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/BsUq9n3)  
or if that's empty, you can read 'n even contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki)  
or if that sucks, maybe you can halp make this site!!, together(!), [here, on the repo](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/)! you can either request for pulls or better yet: i can just give permission to edit them directly

# notes
wouldn't it be nice... to have a simple experimental game database...?    
  - well, it's also quite cool to just have one giant file and use control+f to find what you want. In this way, none of the data hidden!
  - an even better idea: a social discovery site for games! let the people create their favorite game lists

todo:  
auto pull from the wiki (rahil627.github.io/experimental-game-anarchy) to push to the site's repo (/docs)?
  - :O the ultimate simple public wiki solution!
  - ...or could create a folder linked to the contents of the wiki repo
