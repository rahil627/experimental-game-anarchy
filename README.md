# notes
wouldn't it be nice... to have a simple experimental game database...?    
  - well, it's also quite cool to just have one giant file and use control+f to find what you want. In this way, none of the data hidden!

todo:  
auto pull from the wiki (rahil627.github.io/experimental-game-anarchy) to push to the site's repo (/docs)?
  - :O the ultimate simple public wiki solution!
  - ...or could create a folder linked to the contents of the wiki repo
